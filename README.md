# "Digital Cities - Philippines" Web Scraper
This program scrapes the .json file of the data found in "https://www.digitalcitiesph.com/location-profiles/provinces/" for data analysis in my Project SPARTA Data Associate Pathway Capstone project.

I tried to industrialize it for interative & modular future usage, but the output was very messy. The old code is attached to the main program: which is used to parse the manually cleaned .json file into a .csv file for MS Excel.
